# odin-recipes

This is my HTML project from TOP(The Odin Project). The project is about
making a basic website with different recipes. The skills that will be demonstrated throughout this project will be basic git integration, using different HTML elements (which will be listed below), and HTML file structures.

HTML ELEMENTS
    <p> paragraph tags
    <h1> - <h6> heading tags
    <ul> unordered lists
    <ol> ordered list
    <img> image tags
    <a> hyperlink tags
    <strong> bold tag
    <em> italic tag

Git Commands
$ git status = shows status of file, if file is stage, not staged, or if   
                file has been committed
$ git add <file.name> = send file into staging status
$ git commit -m <"file.name"> = saves file that have been changed.
$ git log = shows author, date, and time when commit was made


Disclaimer: I do not own any of the recipes or images that will be used in this project. The recipes and images will be searched using google.
