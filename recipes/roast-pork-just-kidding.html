        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <ol class="center">
            <li>Peel the Potatoes</li>
            -Amount: 6 White Potatoes
            <li>Slice the Potatoes</li>
            -Wash the potatoes then cut them into quarters or halves, depending on size.
            <li>Chop the Mushrooms and Onions into Equally-size Cubes</li>
            -Amount: 3 Eringi mushrooms and 1 large white onion or 2 medium white onions.
            <li>Steam the Potatoes</li>
            -Steam potatoes until soft (about 15-20 minutes).
            -DO NOT steam or microwave the mushrooms.
            <li>Pan Fry the Onions and Mushrooms</li>
            Prep the pan with a tablespoon of butter.
            -Pan fry onions and mushrooms until caramelized or fully golden.
            <li>Mash the Potatoes</li>
            -Mash into small chunks in a large bowl. Do not mash too much, you want to avoid it being frothy to form it to shape.
            <li>Combine the Onions and Mushrooms, Mix with the Potato Mash</li>
            -Mix until the ingredients are even in the bowl.
            <li>Pick the Rosemary</li>
            -Pick the rosemary off its stem.
            -Set aside.
            <li>Add the Salt</li>
            -Add a few sprinkles of salt to the top of the bowl.
            <li>Form the Fake Roast</li>
            -Let the mix cool until touchable (more than 5 minutes). CAUTION HOT  -Take all of the mix and form it into a log shape.
            <li>Wrap the Roast in Bacon</li>
            -Amount: 2 packs of thick-cut bacon.
            -Wrap the roast fully, try not to leave any gaps, otherwise, the potatoes will seep out when the bacon tightens. 
            -There is no surefire way of doing this, just coat it to the best of your ability.
            <li>Tie the Roast</li>
            -Tie the roast with the twine. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just wrap it around a few times.
            -Intertwine the rosemary afterward.
            <li>Bake in the Oven</li>
            -Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 30-45 minutes or until bacon is golden (cook longer for crispy bacon), turning halfway.
            <li>Boil the Wine In the Frying Pan</li>
            -Amount: 1 Cup, or 250ml.
            -Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan. The aim is to reduce it.
            <li>Add the Butter , Sake, and Soy Sauce to the Wine</li>
            -Amount: 1 tbs of butter, 1/4 cup of sake, 2 tbs of soy sauce. 
            -Melt the butter into the boiling wine. 
            -Pour the soy sauce and sake into the sauce. 
            -Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.
            <li>Remove the Twine and the Rosemary</li>
            -When the baking is done, remove the twine and rosemary, they are not to be eaten.
            <li>Pour the Sauce on the Roast</li>
            -Pour the finished sauce onto the roast (make sure the roast is on a plate to hold the extra sauce). Pour slowly.
            <li>Add the Garnish</li>
            -Add a garnish to the top of the dish, we used parsley, the anime used watercress.
            <li>Serve</li>
