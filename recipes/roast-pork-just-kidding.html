        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the Potatoes</li>
            <p>-Amount: 6 White Potatoes</p>
            <li>Slice the Potatoes</li>
            <p>-Wash the potatoes then cut them into quarters or halves, depending on size.</p>
            <li>Chop the Mushrooms and Onions into Equally-size Cubes</li>
            <p>-Amount: 3 Eringi mushrooms and 1 large white onion or 2 medium white onions.</p>
            <li>Steam the Potatoes</li>
            <p>-Steam potatoes until soft (about 15-20 minutes).</p>
            <p>-DO NOT steam or microwave the mushrooms.</p>
            <li>Pan Fry the Onions and Mushrooms</li>
            <p>Prep the pan with a tablespoon of butter.</p>
            <p>-Pan fry onions and mushrooms until caramelized or fully golden.</p>
            <li>Mash the Potatoes</li>
            <p>-Mash into small chunks in a large bowl. Do not mash too much, you want to avoid it being frothy to form it to shape.</p>
            <li>Combine the Onions and Mushrooms, Mix with the Potato Mash</li>
            <p>-Mix until the ingredients are even in the bowl.</p>
            <li>Pick the Rosemary</li>
            <p>-Pick the rosemary off its stem.</p>
            <p>-Set aside.</p>
            <li>Add the Salt</li>
            <p>-Add a few sprinkles of salt to the top of the bowl.</p>
            <li>Form the Fake Roast</li>
            <p>-Let the mix cool until touchable (more than 5 minutes). CAUTION HOT  -Take all of the mix and form it into a log shape.</p>
            <li>Wrap the Roast in Bacon</li>
            <p>-Amount: 2 packs of thick-cut bacon.</p>
            <p>-Wrap the roast fully, try not to leave any gaps, otherwise, the potatoes will seep out when the bacon tightens. </p>
            <p>-There is no surefire way of doing this, just coat it to the best of your ability.</p>
            <li>Tie the Roast</li>
            <p>-Tie the roast with the twine. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just wrap it around a few times.</p>
            <p>-Intertwine the rosemary afterward.</p>
            <li>Bake in the Oven</li>
            <p>-Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 30-45 minutes or until bacon is golden (cook longer for crispy bacon), turning halfway.</p>
            <li>Boil the Wine In the Frying Pan</li>
            <p>-Amount: 1 Cup, or 250ml.</p>
            <p>-Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan. The aim is to reduce it.</p>
            <li>Add the Butter , Sake, and Soy Sauce to the Wine</li>
            <p>-Amount: 1 tbs of butter, 1/4 cup of sake, 2 tbs of soy sauce. </p>
            <p>-Melt the butter into the boiling wine. </p>
            <p>-Pour the soy sauce and sake into the sauce. </p>
            <p>-Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.</p>
            <li>Remove the Twine and the Rosemary</li>
            <p>-When the baking is done, remove the twine and rosemary, they are not to be eaten.</p>
            <li>Pour the Sauce on the Roast</li>
            <p>-Pour the finished sauce onto the roast (make sure the roast is on a plate to hold the extra sauce). Pour slowly.</p>
            <li>Add the Garnish</li>
            <p>-Add a garnish to the top of the dish, we used parsley, the anime used watercress.</p>
