        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut chicken thighs, onion and apple into bite-sized pieces, do not peel the apple.</li>
            <li>Put the Apple and Onion from Step 1 into a food processor and add (Set A) and Puree.</li>
            <li>Put Step 2 in a plastic bag and add the chicken from Step 1. Rub the meat well with 2 and then let sit in the refrigerator overnight to marinate. (for shorter time periods, rub the meat well with Step 2 for 5 minutes, then let marinate for 20 minutes)</li>
            <li>Heat frying oil to 350Â°F. Lightly coat Step 3 with potato starch and deep-fry for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. While frying, use a skimmer to scoop the meat out of the oil briefly one or two times to air (this give it the effect of being "twice-fried")</li>
            <li>Make the Banh Xeo batter. Put (Set B) in a bowl and mix. Slowly add coconut milk, water and beat into a batter with a mixer.</li>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a frying pan then add 1/4 of Step 5. Quickly spread it thinly across the pan and cook on low heat. Once the edges start turning up add one teaspoon of sesame oil all the way around the edges and cook until crispy. Quickly flip with a spatula, briefly cook the other side, and then move to a plate. Cook the remaining three portions of the batter in the same way.</li>
            <li>Place the cilantro, green perilla leaves and lettuce leaves onto Step 6 and add the fried chicken from Step 4. Quickly mix together the hot sauce from (Set C) and pour over the chicken, top with black pepper, and done!</li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
